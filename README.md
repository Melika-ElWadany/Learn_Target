# Learn_Target
This web application is designed for college students to help them identify key topics from their lectures. The primary aim is to guide students on what to study based on the provided homework questions, rather than solving those questions.

Students will submit two inputs: one will be a lecture video or a PDF document, and the other will be a text file containing their homework questions.

## Learn_Target
1. First our tool will allow students to input their homework assignment, which the exam may be based on, and a video lecture or a pdf.
2. Second, the AI powered tool will then return topics and information related to the questions which the students can study on.
