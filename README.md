# Learn_Target
This web application Learn_Target (LWA) aims to address the gap in the education system that overlooks the unique needs of NeuroDivergent learners. Over 50 million Americans are underserved by traditional methods, and this web application is designed to invest in diverse learning styles. Learn_Target specifically focuses on NeuroDivergent college students, providing them with a tool that simplifies their study process by helping them identify key topics from lectures without feeling overwhelmed by excessive information.

Students submit a lecture video or PDF document along with their homework questions in a text file. The platform then highlights the most relevant topics for them to study, allowing students to focus on the material that directly relates to their assignments. The goal is to empower students to navigate their coursework more efficiently and confidently, bridging the learning gap and unlocking the potential of diverse minds.

## Learn_Target
1. First our tool will allow students to input their homework assignment, which the exam may be based on, and a video lecture or a pdf.
2. Second, the AI powered tool will then return the "relevant" topics among the uploaded data. The student then wouldn't need to explore the rest of the data since it does not "directly" relate to the problem at hand. Narrowing down the search.

### Next Steps
Our next steps for this project will be to add new features such as 
- give additional study materials outside of what was inputted by user.
- allow for more than just one study material input.
- allow continuous conversation with the user.
