[00:00 - 00:13]  A scalding volcano, parched desert, and frigid glacier. 
[00:13 - 00:15]  All pretty intense. 
[00:15 - 00:19]  And also all places where certain insects live. 
[00:19 - 00:22]  So how do they do it? 
[00:22 - 00:27]  Our first stop is one of the hottest places on Earth, the Sahara Desert. 
[00:27 - 00:31]  Lots of animals here are only active at night, but not all. 
[00:31 - 00:37]  Sahara silver ant workers brave the desert's blazing sun and scorching sands with unusually 
[00:37 - 00:43]  long legs that elevate their bodies above the hot ground and allow them to reach superlative 
[00:43 - 00:44]  speeds. 
[00:44 - 00:50]  They can sprint a meter per second, each of their feet striking the sand for as little 
[00:50 - 00:56]  as 7 milliseconds at once, making them the fastest ants on record. 
[00:56 - 01:01]  But the reason for their silver sheen is also key to keeping cool. 
[01:01 - 01:05]  The ants are covered in densely packed hair. 
[01:05 - 01:10]  Instead of having a heat-trapping effect, the hair's triangular structure reflects 
[01:10 - 01:13]  sunlight and dissipates heat. 
[01:13 - 01:18]  Researchers observe that it helps reflect 10 times more incoming light and keeps the 
[01:18 - 01:22]  ants around 10 degrees cooler than if they were hairless. 
[01:22 - 01:28]  Meanwhile, this longhorned beetle also sports triangular hairs that give it a metallic shimmer 
[01:28 - 01:30]  and cool it down. 
[01:30 - 01:36]  Helpful, since it resides near active Thai and Indonesian volcanoes, where ground temperatures 
[01:36 - 01:40]  can reach 70 degrees Celsius. 
[01:40 - 01:43]  Many insects thrive in balmy biomes. 
[01:43 - 01:48]  But cold temperatures, like those looming over this isolated landscape, are a major 
[01:48 - 01:51]  constraint on insect life. 
[01:51 - 01:56]  And yet, certain insects actually depend on these cool climates year-round. 
[01:56 - 02:02]  One small group, sometimes called ice crawlers, lives in high-elevation caves and at the edges 
[02:02 - 02:03]  of glaciers. 
[02:03 - 02:08]  They've evolved to thrive in a narrow zone of cool temperatures. 
[02:08 - 02:12]  Scientists think one way they manage this is their increased capacity to produce a type 
[02:12 - 02:17]  of sugar that helps stabilize their cell membranes, proteins, and DNA. 
[02:17 - 02:21]  But they've lost the ability to deal with temperature extremes. 
[02:21 - 02:26]  For instance, just the heat of your hand could kill them, given enough time. 
[02:26 - 02:33]  Now for a more savory flavor of survival skills, we have the alkali fly. 
[02:33 - 02:39]  They live around and in California's Mono Lake, which is more than twice as salty as 
[02:39 - 02:40]  the ocean. 
[02:40 - 02:47]  As aquatic larvae, they depend on specialized, kidney-like organs to excrete excess salt. 
[02:47 - 02:52]  And as adults, they must continue to venture underwater regularly to eat and lay eggs. 
[02:52 - 02:58]  However, at their size, overcoming the water's surface tension and staying submerged is a 
[02:58 - 02:59]  challenge. 
[02:59 - 03:05]  They manage to exert forces up to 18 times their weight to break the surface tension, 
[03:05 - 03:11]  then use their claws to counteract their buoyancy in the salty water and stay put down below. 
[03:11 - 03:16]  Because their bodies are covered in more hair and hydrophobic wax than other flies, they're 
[03:16 - 03:22]  surrounded by an air bubble that keeps them dry and provides them with up to 15 minutes 
[03:22 - 03:23]  of oxygen. 
[03:23 - 03:28]  When they release their hold, they pop right back up to the surface, perfectly dry. 
[03:28 - 03:34]  However, only one insect group is known to actually withstand the ocean's depths. 
[03:34 - 03:41]  These are parasitic lice, and they live on deep-sea diving pinnipeds like seals and walruses. 
[03:41 - 03:45]  Their plunges can take the lice thousands of meters underwater for extended periods. 
[03:45 - 03:51]  Most insects use holes on the sides of their abdomens called spiracles to take in oxygen. 
[03:51 - 03:55]  Interestingly, these lice are equipped with microscopic structures that allow them to 
[03:55 - 03:58]  shut their spiracles entirely. 
[03:58 - 04:03]  Scientists think this may help them keep air inside or prevent water from entering, allowing 
[04:03 - 04:08]  them to survive long periods submerged in high-pressure conditions. 
[04:08 - 04:13]  Some lice may also attain oxygen by living on seals whose fur traps air close to their 
[04:13 - 04:14]  bodies. 
[04:14 - 04:19]  Meanwhile, lice on marine mammals with less hair seem to have more scale-like structures 
[04:19 - 04:25]  on their abdomens, which might help them trap a little layer of air all for themselves. 
[04:25 - 04:30]  Insects are the world's most numerous and diverse animals. 
[04:30 - 04:34]  Even in some of the places you might least expect them, there they are, equipped with 
[04:34 - 04:40]  extreme survival skills, living life on the edge. 
[04:40 - 04:45]  Now meet the tardigrade, one of the toughest species on Earth, able to survive its hottest 
[04:45 - 04:50]  and coldest environments, go without water for decades, and withstand high levels of 
[04:50 - 04:51]  radiation.
